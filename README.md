### Vending Machine Kata TDD
Developed by Brandon Niles

Built with Ruby 2.3.3 & RSpec 3.7.0

## Notes
- This Kata was began with Jitendra for the purpose of observing my thought process. Since that was the primary goal of this kata, two things should happen to ensure that goal is achieved.
  1. Observation of all the tests running and passing.
  2. Most importantly, a link to a video was attached with this kata via email. The video contains a screenshare of me breaking down my code bit by bit and explaining my thought process. Is is crucial to the goal of this kata that the video is watched before observing this code. If there were no video to accompany this code, this README would be quite a bit more thorough in explaining the reasoning behind why certain things were done.

  Link to the video explain my thought process:

## Dependencies
Run `bundle install` before running app to sync dependencies.

##### RSpec
Tests are run with RSpec.

##### Rake
Tasks typically run with Rake, however for this kata, since it is purely a thought process observation exercise, there are no tasks to be run.

## To run tests:
Tests are run with RSpec.

From the main project directory (bn_tdd_vm),
Type `rspec` to run all tests at once.

For a better read out of each test add the flag `--format documentation`
so it reads: `rspec --format documentation`

## Note: This README is brief because there is a video that explains my thought process, please watch that first.
